Previous Session recap:
This years students have been divided into a cohort who you will continue training with for the next several months. The group has been assigned two leaders to watch over the group who were given 24 hours to prep the group for there next mission in however they see fit. The group proceeded to have a 1 on 1 fight with 6 members and the winner was ultimately Limpie. The group proceeded to do 4 other trials with various success and the last puzzle trial has been completed. Pann Pann and Cloud have a remaining 14 hours or so left to prepare for the mission that can be started with the sunrise. It is currently dusk and you are about an hours walk outside of the temple of the Jade Serpant. What would you like to do.

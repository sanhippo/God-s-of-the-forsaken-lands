Introduction to the Campaign.

**Welcome to God's of the Fractured Lands.** 

**"Shrouded in fog since the world was sundered more than ten thousand years ago, the ancient realm of Pandaria has remained unspoiled by war. Its lush forests and cloud-ringed mountains are home to a complex ecosystem of indigenous races and exotic creatures. It is the homeland of the enigmatic Pandaren, a group of races that celebrates life to the fullest even while under siege by an ancient menace."**

**You have all made your way** **Through volunteering or through conscription to the eastern heart of the jade forest. The races of pandaria maintain a temple to the Jade Serpant, a venerable spirit of wisdom and foresight.  Here, overlooking Pandaria's coast, the myriad races of the continent come to meditate for insight or peruse the living archives of the temple's library, where Pandaria's history is literally brought to life. The temple is particularly sacred to the fish-like  races, who use its scrying pool to serve as their eyes and ears throughout the continent.

Here you have all just completed your first 2 weeks of training. Having completed enough training to understand  the basics of the path before you. You group in the courtyard before the sun rises. Ready for to see who will be in your cohort you all stand in the court yard to listen to master Snowdrift an awakened panda and the head master of the temple of the jade forest speech.  Some of you already have met him others wishing to some day. He goes through a list of names calling two people to the middle of the stair case to assemble there coharts and get introductions under way.  The first group being Ko'kron Ironstar a Kitsune , Zhong Fu an awakened turtle are called for first and have a brief conversation before the rest are called , Silk a catfolk, Parnassia a ghoran and Epeu Goldentongue a shoony. Many more names are called forming other coharts until finally your names are called. 

Pan Pan, Cloud  are called forward first and have a brief conversation with Master Snowdrift before he calls for the rest of the group. Limpie, Loch, and Bill. You all assemble in a small group at the base of the stairs as master snow drift goes on. 

The two from each cohort called first will act as leaders for the next 24 hours to help get the groups working together as they have your first mission and you may begin it as soon as the sun rises tomorrow. From this day forward you will work with your cohart for the rest of training and likely for the rest of your lives or until retirement sets in at least. Complete the mission laid out before you and return for further training. However I will ask you to ponder something. To Ask why we fight, is to ask why leaves fall. It is in their nature. perhaps there is a better question. As he says this he walks towards the edge of the cliff near the top of the stairs and jumps into the air and lands on a cloud serpent and heads off in the northern direction. 



Many of the other groups are talking amongst them self's others are heading off in groups to get better acquainted. What would you all like to do.

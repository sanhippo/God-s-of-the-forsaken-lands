## Pandaria




Pandaria is surrounded by magical mists conjured by the Last God Emperor Shaohao before he disappeared immediately after many millennium ago. 
Any attempt to leave the island has been unsuccessful well at least the parties who have ventured into the mist have never returned to the island.



### The Mogu

The Mongu were Constructs created by the a demi-god known as Ra-den to protect the lands of Pandarai who eventually Sercombe to the curse of the flesh .  There was multiple tribes that fought amongst them self's but would be forced to put there differences aside to assault the incoming Mantid invasion every 100 years. As soon as the Mantids were pushed back the warlords would go back to fighting each other. Eventually one of the two waring clans was destroyed and one of the the members of the destroyed faction was a man called Lei Shen.

Lei Shen searched the lands for the original Mongu leaders and stumbled upon the resting place of a man called Ra-Den. Discoverying Ra-Den was still alived and had betrayed his original mission to protect Pandaria and was enraged. The Young Mogu (Lei Shen) defeated his master and imprisoned him and stole the power of the cosmic shard (Eternity's essence). He then became known as the Thunder King and railed an army of Mogu behind himself and claimed to be ruler of all in his domain (Pandaria) concurring  the rest of the races.

Lei Shen's rule was crewel but it did succeed in causing all in the lands to be united under one rule. Giving birth to a single language they all shared and one set of laws. Eventually Lei Shen left with a vast army to go determine what was outside the mist. His body appeared in the temple where he fought Ra-Den. The shard by his side once again. 


### Races

The Races of Pandaria are listed below and generally refereed to as a group called the Pandaren.

- Shoony
- Ghoran
- Awakened Animal
- Tengu
- Kitsune
- Catfolk

They worshiped the ancient spirits of the lands until Lei Shen defeated them and enslaved them. 


### Kang

After the death of Lei Shen one of the Pandaren called Kang started a plot to overthrow the Mogu.

The emperor at the time, Lao-Fe the Slavebinder, was a monster among beasts even by mogu standards. His favored punishment among pandaren slaves was to separate families. Slaves who displeased him would have their children sent to the Serpent's Spine wall, to suffer and die as fodder for the mantid swarms. This was the fate that befell Kang, a young monk and brewmaster. His cub, Sheilun, was sent to the mantid, and his wife died trying to stop it. Kang was so grief-stricken over the loss of his family that he chose to wear all black. In a moment of clarity, he saw the mogu overlords for what they were: weak. They possessed dark magics and horrific weapons, but their empire was completely reliant on slave labor. Since the servant races were not permitted to carry weapons during the reign of the mogu, Kang determined that the pandaren themselves would become the weapons. History does not report if Kang and his son ever met again, but it was this father's love that sparked the rebellion that would change the face of Pandaria forever.

One day, Kang issued a challenge to his fellow slaves to hit him. Surprised, the beleaguered pandaren slaves tried to strike Kang. One by one they failed, for he intercepted their blows like a dancer and sidestepped their attacks like a reed in the wind. Kang told the slaves, "Our backs are hardened by the whips of the mogu. Our arms are powerful from building their fortresses. Our minds are sharp from working alongside our enemy. You think the mogu are stronger? I say we are their strength!" Inspired by his defiance, the slaves begged Kang to teach them to fight. So it came to pass that pandaren monks began their training in the martial arts, and Kang became known as the Fist of First Dawn.

The Mogu forces were pushed back and back until eventually they had one finial assault against the forces led by Kang himself and were successful however Kang died from wounds suffered in the battle.

Peace was brought to the lands once again and the Pandaren empire was born.

### Rumors

Y'Shaarj One of the original gods is rumored to have been slayed on this island and his blood soaks the land causing powerful emotions to bring forth beings called Sha (Spirit Demons). 




### The Mantid
One of the main enemies of the Pandari are the Mantid. The mantid are an intelligent and highly evolved race of insect-like creatures who have menaced the people of Pandaria since prehistoric times. While their society has a queen, they don't operate as a hive mind.
They are sentient beings, capable of constructing tall buildings and mastering weapons.

Mantid act with individual cunning, making them formidable in single combat and unstoppable when their numbers converge. Every mantid generation, the young hatch in incredible numbers and then swarm toward the rest of Pandaria, devouring anything in their path. Only the strongest return. Although the ancient mogu managed to protect their lands by building a gigantic wall between themselves and the mantid, the generational swarms require an all-hands defense of the wall or the very heart of Pandaria will be lost.

The mantid have poison that chews through the skin and infects the blood. It makes for slow, excruciating death when not treated.

Newly hatched mantid have only two instincts: kill and feed. They turn on one another, devouring the weak and leaving the strongest to mature. Those hatched during a swarm - the swarmborn - are turned loose on their enemies instead.

The time for the next assault will soon be upon our lands.

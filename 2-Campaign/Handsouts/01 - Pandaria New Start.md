Pandaria is surrounded by magical mists conjured by the Last God Emperor Shaohao before he disappeared immediately after many millennium ago. 
Any attempt to leave the island has been unsuccessful well at least the parties who have ventured into the mist have never returned to the island.


# History 


##### The Original Gods

One of the Three original Gods known as Ra-Den was the ruler over the lands now known as Pandaria. He created a group of constructs known as the Mogu who were designed to protect his home lands of Pandaria. Eventually Ra-Den was ripped from the world due to an unknown force causing his life force to be spread across the land of Pandaria infecting it with a parasite called the Sha.


##### The Mogu

The Mogu were Constructs created by the god Ra-den to protect the lands of Pandaria. Over time, the mogu fell under the influence of the Curse of Flesh and became obsessed with their mission of bringing peace and order, to the point where they came to believe that all other races must bow to their order. This led to the tumultuous Age of a Hundred Kings. During this time, a warrior named Lei Shen decided to take the future of Pandaria into his own hands. He traveled to the Isle of Thunder and brutally defeated Ra-Den, ripping out and eating his heart, gaining Ra's power over wind and storm. Crowned the Thunder King, none could stand against Lei Shen's mission to bring peace and order to Pandaria through tyranny. His construction of the Serpent's Spine to separate the dreaded mantid from the rest of Pandaria's races is often cited as his greatest achievement. However, the mantid would adapt to this, swarming the Serpent's Spine every 100 years so that the weak would die and only the strong would return. Being a long-lived race, they would grow stronger with each generation. Lei Shen eventually died of old age, leaving weaker mogu emperors to rule in his stead.


##### Kang - Fist of First Dawn

After the death of Lei Shen one of the Pandaren (The name of all the intelligent non mogu races of Pandaria see races below) called Kang started a plot to overthrow the Mogu.

The emperor at the time, Lao-Fe the Slavebinder, was a monster among beasts even by mogu standards. His favored punishment among pandaren slaves was to separate families. Slaves who displeased him would have their children sent to the Serpent's Spine wall, to suffer and die as fodder for the mantid swarms. This was the fate that befell Kang, a young monk and brewmaster. His cub, Sheilun, was sent to the mantid, and his wife died trying to stop it. Kang was so grief-stricken over the loss of his family that he chose to wear all black. In a moment of clarity, he saw the mogu overlords for what they were: weak. They possessed dark magics and horrific weapons, but their empire was completely reliant on slave labor. Since the servant races were not permitted to carry weapons during the reign of the mogu, Kang determined that the pandaren themselves would become the weapons. History does not report if Kang and his son ever met again, but it was this father's love that sparked the rebellion that would change the face of Pandaria forever.

One day, Kang issued a challenge to his fellow slaves to hit him. Surprised, the beleaguered pandaren slaves tried to strike Kang. One by one they failed, for he intercepted their blows like a dancer and sidestepped their attacks like a reed in the wind. Kang told the slaves, "Our backs are hardened by the whips of the mogu. Our arms are powerful from building their fortresses. Our minds are sharp from working alongside our enemy. You think the mogu are stronger? I say we are their strength!" Inspired by his defiance, the slaves begged Kang to teach them to fight. So it came to pass that pandaren monks began their training in the martial arts, and Kang became known as the Fist of First Dawn.

When word of the movement reached mogu ears, Kang and his followers relocated to Kun-Lai Summit and secretly built a monastery to continue their training. To his vast surprise, Kang also found the prison of one of the August Celestials: Xuen, the White Tiger. Kang often communed with the imprisoned Celestial, learning the secrets of inner strength and passing these lessons on to the other students. Xuen taught Kang not only the strength of raw power, but the strength of endurance. He told the pandaren that to know strength, he had to look to the little life he could find in the heights. Kang looked, and saw the twisted, gnarled trees growing along the Kun-Lai ridgelines. The trees' trunks were sturdy and strong and their roots were deep, as they needed to be in order for them to endure the biting winds. The pandaren used these trees to build the walls of their monastery and craft their first weapons — not blades, like the mogu used, but staves. Kang brought his staff to Xuen, who blessed it, after which the monk named it "Sheilun" after his late son. He continued to carry the staff with him throughout the revolution. On some days, it was a mere walking stick, but on others, it saved his life by deflecting the blows of mogu axes or swords.

The rebels won several major victories. Eventually, Lao-Fe's forces retreated to the Vale of Eternal Blossoms, and Kang knew that the rebels needed to expose themselves and launch an attack. Without hesitation, Kang led the charge deep into the Vale and fought Lao-Fe hand-to-hand. The monk succeeded in defeating the emperor, but sustained mortal wounds in the process. The former slave and the Slavebinder died together, but with his sacrifice, Kang had freed all of Pandaria. His staff was brought back to the monastery that he and his monks had constructed in the mountains and continued to be used in service to Pandaria for generations to come.


##### The Mists

The empire prospered until the time of Emperor Shaohao, who later became known as the Last Emperor. Wishing to save his people from the forthcoming War of the Ancients, he conquered his own vices by burying the six prime sha of doubt, despair, violence, anger, hatred, and fear within the land. With the help of the August Celestials (Powerful Spirits of the island), he became one with the land and isolated it from the rest of the world to make it safe. 


##### Recent Events

The campaign starts with the preparation for the local Brewfest festival. A Festival for competing breweries to gain recognition and to celebrate the peace on the island. The festival is hosted by the two main factions of the island.
Currently the land is ruled by the August Celstials


###### Tushui
The way of the Tushui is one of gaining proper perspective. Through meditation and consideration, we find our way to be the most effective solution to any problem. Through practice and discipline, we honor our bodies to be the perfect implements of our will. To live the way of the Tushui is to be respected both for tempered mind and impeccable form

The Tushui pandaren are contemplative, focused on abstract ideals of justice and morality, and believe that a principled life is the only one worth living. Their idealogical opposites are the Huojin.

###### Huojin
Led by the intrepid Ji Firepaw, the Huojin Pandaren are quick to act and quicker to fight for what they believe in. The Huojin firmly believe injustice must be met with a swift and decisive response, though this response should be flexible and calculated for the situation at hand; to the Huojin, the end will always ultimately justify the means. Those who follow the path of the Houjin are impulsive, quick to action, and practical. To them, inaction in the face of adversity will always be the greatest injustice. Their ideological opposites are the Tushui.




### Races

The Races of Pandaria are listed below and generally refereed to as a group called the Pandaren.

### The Mantid
One of the main enemies of the Pandari are the Mantid. The mantid are an intelligent and highly evolved race of insect-like creatures who have menaced the people of Pandaria since prehistoric times. While their society has a queen, they don't operate as a hive mind.
They are sentient beings, capable of constructing tall buildings and mastering weapons.

Mantid act with individual cunning, making them formidable in single combat and unstoppable when their numbers converge. Every mantid generation, the young hatch in incredible numbers and then swarm toward the rest of Pandaria, devouring anything in their path. Only the strongest return. Although the ancient mogu managed to protect their lands by building a gigantic wall between themselves and the mantid, the generational swarms require an all-hands defense of the wall or the very heart of Pandaria will be lost.

The mantid have poison that chews through the skin and infects the blood. It makes for slow, excruciating death when not treated.

Newly hatched mantid have only two instincts: kill and feed. They turn on one another, devouring the weak and leaving the strongest to mature. Those hatched during a swarm - the swarmborn - are turned loose on their enemies instead.

The time for the next assault is less then a century away.

###### The Jade Forest

![[Pasted image 20240828122851.png | 800]]
This land of cloud-ringed mountains and hidden bamboo thickets runs along Pandaria's eastern shore. The landscape of the Jade Forest is verdant and lush. High spires dot the region and its coastal areas, and the flora is diverse in several areas of the land. Pandaren buildings, such as temples, monasteries, farmlands are prominently gracing the land and fascinate its curious visitors that have managed to get past the mists shrouding the continent. In some places, ancient mogu ruins can be found - one example are the Terrace of Ten Thunders in the north.

###### Valley of the Four Winds
![[Pasted image 20240828122443.png | 800]]
Renowned for its tranquil farmlands and bustling breweries, the Valley of the Four Winds is a land rich with fertile soil and pristine waters. Although this thriving heartland's residents are plagued by virmen and other pests, they face an even greater threat from the savage mantid of the nearby Dread Wastes. The majority of the Valley of the Four Winds consists of gently rolling hills along varying levels of elevation. There are numerous pools and marshes, as well as waterfalls that both spill into the Valley and cascade from the Valley into the Krasarang Wilds to the south. The heart of the Valley is where most of the pandaren farms and settlements are located. The northern border consists of sheer cliffs, separating the valley from the Vale of Eternal Blossoms. A steep path cut through the mountain leads through the Veiled Stair to Kun-Lai Summit. The western border of the valley is sealed by the Great Wall, which has kept the mantid at bay for time immemorial.  The Yan-Zhe River cuts along the southern border, and a thin strip of land beyond consists of the Cliffs of Despair. Access to the Krasarang Wilds beyond can only be done at either end of the cliffs via steep slopes that roll their way downward. There is only one forest within the valley, and that is in the northwest. Thick with bamboo, it is shrouded in dense fog.

###### Krasarang Wilds - Restricted Access
![[Pasted image 20240828122509.png | 800]]
Once home to a sprawling mogu port, the dense Krasarang Wilds stretch along Pandaria's southern shores. Most pandaren avoid this shadowy place as it is banned for travel and its dangerous inhabitants, but groups of intrepid fishermen have been known to brave the wilds and ply their trade in the area's bountiful coastal waters.

The only true grasslands to be found are just down the slope from the Valley of the Four Winds, near Zhu's Watch. These gently rolling hills soon dissolve as they are overtaken by the thick jungle that blankets most of the inland region. Thick trees draped with vines can be found around every corner, and a handful of rivers wind their way through the moss and ruins that dot the landscape. The Cliffs of Despair serve as the northern border to the Wilds, while sparkling beaches and island-studded waters comprise the south.


###### Kun-Lai-Summit
![[Pasted image 20240828122558.png | 800]]
Chill winds lash this snowy mountain region, site of a breathtaking temple complex devoted to the powerful spirit of the White Tiger, Xuen. Among Kun-Lai's denizens are members of the Shado-pan — an elite order of highly disciplined pandaren fighters dedicated to protecting their empire from any threat

Kun-Lai Summit is no doubt one of the coldest places in all of Pandaria. The southern lands are much more vibrant and warmer, reminding somewhat of autumn, while the lands of the north are much more barren and most of them covered in snow. This is because the mountains are actually the highest in all of the known world. The only way into the summit that is not sealed off by the Serpent's Spine is through the Hidden Pass. The key trade route of Kun-Lai is the Burlap Trail, that is run by the Tengu. Many Catfolk warmongers are constantly trying to expand their territory, having been driven away from Townlong Steppes by the Mantid and desperately looking for a place to set up their new homes. In the mountains, many ancient Mogu ruins and crypts can be found, and the Mogu themselves,have recently arrived there are uncovering their secrets. The pandaren have two major holdouts in the region - Temple of the White Tiger and Shado-pan Monastery.  


###### Townlong Steppes
![[Pasted image 20240828122639.png | 800]]
Only the bravest pandaren dare enter these highlands. Although the area remains uncorrupted by the Sha, only the nomadic Catfolk and the mantid choose to make the region their home.
The contiguous areas of the steppes consist of grass-covered hills sprinkled with red-leafed trees. The northeastern areas are more sparse, with great rocky crags, mostly taken by the Catfolk. A deep divide separates the bulk of the steppes from the Dread Wastes, and within this divide is a marsh and river that leads out to the sea. There is also a small pocket of bog or marsh situated in the eastern side of the steppes, south of Longying Outpost.

There are a handful of islands that make up the western half of the steppes. The southwestern-most and western island are both taken by the mantid, with their great central trees and pod-like architecture. The northern-most island has the most caves and is home to sprites and cloud serpents, dotted with ancient ruins. More steep hills can be found here, as well as a heavy mogu presence.


###### The Dread Wastes
![[Pasted image 20240828122729.png | 800]]

The Dread Wastes are an area of Pandaria, located south of Townlong Steppes and west of the Valley of the Four Winds and Vale of Eternal Blossoms. Separated from the rest of Pandaria by the Serpent's Spine constructed during the rule of Lei Shen, the Dread Wastes are the home of the Mantid. The landscape is dotted with massive Kypari trees that produce the amber which the Mantid utilize in many ways.

The Dread Wastes are the southern portion of Townlong region separated from the rest of Pandaria mainland by the great wall, Serpent's Spine. It is very similar to its northern counterpart, except that it apparently became twisted by sinister energies and a dark gloom blankets over the land along with a swath of sha-corrupted soil. In the center of the twisted path stands the imperial palace of the mantid race, known as the Heart of Fear, a paragon to the Sha of Fear which took the entire race into its sway through their empress, Shek'zeer. The mantid Kyparis along the path have also been corrupted by the unstable energies. 

###### Vale of Eternal Blossoms

![[Pasted image 20240828122753.png | 800]]
The Vale of Eternal Blossoms is a region at the center of the continent of Pandaria, and has great cultural importance to both the pandaren and mogu, particularly due to the Mogu'shan Palace. Formerly known as a Cradle of Life and used as a place of experimentation. This vale of golden flowers and trees served as the seat of power for the rulers of Pandaria, such as the mogu rulers following the death of Lei Shen.
